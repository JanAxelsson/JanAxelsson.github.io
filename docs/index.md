Welcome to my GitHub Pages
==========================

 

I have two major public projects here

 

Pragma-git
----------

 

### The aim with *Pragma-git* is to be

-   ”pragmatic” — aiming to be the opposite to how many beginners perceive
    *git*, but yet having all functionality for pros

-   easy to start — and something to grow in for daily programming tasks

-   friendly — guiding you through risks of data loss with pop-up warnings and
    instructions

 

### Differences to other git clients

-   small window — no need hiding other apps

-   easy overview of project state

-   show buttons only when applicable — less confusion

-   note taking — todo lists and notes at your finger tips

 

imlook4d
--------

This medical image processing software has been used in research since 2005, and
features have been added continuously

 

### The aim with *imlook4d* is to be

-   Easy to extend with own scripts in MATLAB (two extra lines integrates your
    script with imlook4d GUI)

-   Reads all standard radiological formats (DICOM, Nifti, Analyze, ECAT…)

-   4D viewer, with VOI analysis, and pharmaco-kinetic modelling

-   Integrates with SPM and ImageJ

 

### Differences to other viewers

-   A problem solver for research — add your own interactive algorithms, do
    better research
