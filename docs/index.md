Welcome to my GitHub Pages
==========================

 

I have two large public projects here

 

**Pragma-git**
--------------

[Visit github page](https://janaxelsson.github.io/Pragma-git/). [Download
installer](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wyrx7fq9nuvfgnb/AABHgmInOA2NinioGCYEE208a?dl=0).

### The aim with "Pragma-git" is to be

-   ”pragmatic” — aiming to be the opposite to how many beginners perceive *git*

-   yet with standard functionality for pros

-   easy to start — and something to grow in for daily programming tasks

-   friendly — guiding you through risks of data loss with pop-up warnings and
    instructions

 

### Differences to other git clients

-   small window — no need hiding other apps

-   easy overview of project state

-   show buttons only when applicable — less confusion

-   note taking — todo lists and notes at your finger tips

-   and of course dark and light modes

-   Mac, Windows, Linux installers

**imlook4d**
------------

This medical image processing software has been used in research since 2005, and
features have been added continuously.[ More
details](https://janaxelsson.github.io/imlook4d/).

 

### The aim with ”imlook4d" is to 

-   be easy to extend with own scripts in MATLAB (two extra lines integrates
    your script with imlook4d GUI)

-   read standard radiological formats (DICOM, Nifti, Analyze, ECAT…)

 

### Differences to other viewers

-   a problem solver for research — add your own interactive algorithms, do
    better research

-   4D viewer, with VOI analysis, and pharmaco-kinetic modelling

-   integrate with SPM and ImageJ
